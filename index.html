                I'm a career-switcher moving from education leadership into the world of
                tech. First drawn to software development when supporting my pupils on their own
                coding journeys, I soon realised how exciting a career in tech
                would be. As a maths specialist teacher, I have always 
                relished problem solving and software development gives me the opportunity
                to use these skills to create something real which can have an 
                impact on the world.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                After completing a degree in psychology and sociology 
                at the University of Brighton, and gaining experience working with children,
                I decided to pursue a career in teaching. I completed a Postgraduate Certificate in 
                Education at the University of East London. After a couple of years in teaching, 
                having been recognised for having a particular aptitude for maths teaching, 
                I completed a further Postgraduate Certificate in Maths 
                Specialist Teaching. Over the years, maths has become a passion of mine
                and it has been great to use these skills on my coding journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time working in education, I have taken on various leadership roles that eventually led me to 
                become an assistant headteacher. I started as Maths Lead at a school in Greenwich, 
                focusing on improving maths teaching across the school. When I moved to a school in 
                Tower Hamlets, I became the Pupil Voice Lead, 
                where I combined my passion for the environment with giving students a say in school 
                matters and the world around them. In this role, I worked closely with the student council 
                to ensure students' voices were heard. I also promoted the Sustainable Development Goals 
                and the United Nations Charter on the Rights of the Child. One of my proudest moments 
                was leading the student council in a campaign to reduce unsafe parking and pollution outside the school, 
                where our efforts led to the students becoming the youngest individuals to present a petition at a local 
                council meeting. Within this role, I also led the school in earning the Unicef Rights Respecting Gold Award.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside my various roles in leadership, teaching also gave me my first
                experiences of coding, something I hadn't been taught in my own school career. Over the years, 
                I have used a range of different programs such as Scratch to support pupils in taking their 
                first foray into coding. Together, we completed a range of projects such as creating platform 
                games, working together to solve problems and make the different parts of the game work 
                in the desired way. It was great to see all pupils, even those
                who were often disengaged, find success and truly enjoy learning.  
            </p>

            <p >
                Teaching at the primary level let me use and grow a wide range of skills and interests, from 
                my love for the environment and art to maths, sports, and computing.  
                It has also enabled me to further develop other skills essential for my future career, 
                through mentoring new teachers, overcoming challenges, presenting ideas to a range of audiences,
                working successfully in a range of different teams, leading a large team as an assistant 
                headteacher and effecting change in a work-place. I have a wide range of passions and interests, 
                and I'm excited to find a position where I can put them all to good use.
