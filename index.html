          I'm a career-switcher with a passion for maths and computing, moving
          from education leadership into the world of tech. First drawn to
          software development when supporting my pupils on their own coding
          journeys, I soon realised how exciting a career in tech would be. As a
          maths specialist teacher, I have always relished problem solving, and
          software development gives me the opportunity to use these skills to
          create something real which can have an impact on the world.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a software developer with 15 years experience working as 
          a teacher and leader in education. I hold a degree in Applied Psychology and Sociology, 
          as well as a Postgraduate Certificate in Education and a 
          Postgraduate Certificate in Mathematics Specialist Teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my most recent role in education, I worked as an assistant
          headteacher at a large inner-London school where I was responsible for
          the quality of teaching and learning for a third of the school,
          comprising approximately 30 members of staff and 270 pupils. I have also worked 
          as a Pupil Voice Lead, where I led on environmental education and
          human rights. In this role, I championed environmental issues and led the 
          school in earning the 
          <a href="https://www.unicef.org.uk/rights-respecting-schools/getting-started/gold/what-is-gold/">
            Unicef Rights Respecting Gold Award</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          My time as a teacher has given me skills in
          communication, mentoring, time management and prioritisation and also
          gave me my first taste of software development, when teaching children
          how to code. I have wanted to transition into software development for
          a long time and finally took the leap this year. I have completing a great deal of 
          self-guided learning, building proficiency in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am now enrolled on the 
          <a href="https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/foundation/http/schedule/">
          Founders and Coders Software Development bootcamp</a> where I am honing my skills
          in JavaScript and other areas such as git workflow and testing. So far, 
          I have successfully collaborated on a number of projects
          which can be viewed in the 'Projects' section. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My short term ambition is to earn a place on an
          apprenticeship program where I can further develop my technical skills
          and put them into practice in real-world projects. In the future, I
          would love to work projects which can positively impact the planet and
          future generations, from education apps, to technology which supports
          sustainability and the environment.
