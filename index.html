                I'm a career-switcher moving from education leadership into the world of
                tech. First drawn to software development when supporting my pupils on their own
                coding journeys, I soon realised how exciting a career in tech
                would be. As a maths specialist teacher, I have always 
                relished problem solving and software development gives me the opportunity
                to use these skills to create something real which can have an 
                impact on the world.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                After completing a degree in psychology and sociology 
                at Brighton University and gaining experience working with children in various 
                roles, I decided to pursue a career in teaching. 
                I completed a Postgraduate Certificate 
                in Education at the University of East London. 
                After a couple of years in teaching, having realised
                that I had a particular aptitude for maths teaching, I completed
                a further Postgraduate Certificate in Maths Specialist Teaching. Over the years,
                maths has become a passion of mine and by far my favourite subject to teach.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                
                During my time in education, I've taken on various leadership roles that eventually led me to 
                become an assistant headteacher. I started as a Maths Lead, focusing on improving maths teaching 
                across the school. 
                When I changed schools, I soon became the Pupil Voice Lead, 
                where I combined my passion for the environment with giving students a say in school matters and 
                the world around them.
                In this role, I worked closely with the student council to ensure students' voices were heard. 
                I also promoted the Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Charter on the Rights 
                of the Child. One of my proudest moments was leading the student council in a campaign to reduce
                unsafe driving and pollution near the school, where our efforts 
                led to the students becoming the youngest individuals to present a petition at a local 
                council meeting. 
                Within this role, I also led the school in earning the Unicef Rights Respecting Gold Award.
            </p>

            <p >
                Teaching at the primary level let me use and grow a wide range of skills and interests, from 
                my love for the environment and art to maths, sports, and computing.  
                It has also enabled me to further develop other skills essential for my future career, 
                through mentoring new teachers, presenting ideas to a range of audiences,
                working in a range of different teams, leading a large team as an assistant headteacher and 
                effecting change in a large work-place. I still have a wide range of passions and interests, 
                but my ultimate goal is to one day help create software which will 
                aid the environment and sustainability. I would return to my educational roots in some capacity,
                supporting others on their coding journeys.
